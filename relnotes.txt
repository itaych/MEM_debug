MEM_debug Release Notes
-----------------------
v1.0.16, 20210205
-----------------
Fixed potential crash during shutdown.

v1.0.15, 20210202
-----------------
Added get_largest_thread to return the TID and size (allocated memory) of the thread that has allocated the most memory. In some cases this can be useful to trace a growing memory leak.
Support aligned_alloc (thanks @horde3d).

v1.0.14, 20200913
-----------------
Fixed some string overflow warnings that occurred since g++ 8.

v1.0.13, 20191117
-----------------
* Initializing global_bytes_alloced_limit with std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max() didn't work in some cases, switched to 0 as the default value.

v1.0.12, 20191117
-----------------
* Removed "mem_debug" prefix from most API functions, as the namespace
already covers that for C++. C API is unchanged.
* Added function set_memory_limit to set an upper bound on the total
amount of memory allocated from the heap. This can help debug cases
where your heap usage grows unexpectedly.

v1.0.11, 20190919
-----------------
* due to missing extern "C" declaration, memalign was not intercepted. Added missing declaration to memalign and all other intercepted functions for consistency.

v1.0.10, 20190814
-----------------
* fixed a race condition in mem_debug_check: num_global_allocs was read outside of critical section.

v1.0.9, 20190514
----------------
* Changed method to store thread-specific statistics, which was causing mutex recursion errors. Now uses std::map, with a simple custom allocator to bypass mem_debug's own allocations. This eliminates the c++11 requirement, so removed the check.
* added safe_print_dec() to print decimal numbers.
* added "MEM_debug" prefix to user error messages.
* changed MemDebugInfo to not use printf when printing the startup banner.

v1.0.8, 20190512
----------------
* added mem_debug_total_mallocs.

v1.0.7, 20190423
----------------
* simplified mem_debug_check.

v1.0.6, 20190415
----------------
* fixed "mutex recursion error" message that appeared occasionally. It was caused by access to a thread local counter after the thread had exited. Per-thread statistics now require c++11.
* added global count of total malloc/free calls, printed at program exit summary.
* nicer output of mem_debug_show_leak_list, quoted string buffers now have whitespaces escaped.
* MD_LOG_* macros (for calling an external logger, or printf by default) are no longer called from a critical section, so they may allocate memory if desired.

v1.0.5, 20181220
----------------
* mem_debug_clear_leak_list now optionally restarts allocation serial numbers from 0. When looking for a leak this is helpful for finding patterns in leaking allocations.
* mem_debug_abort_on_allocation now accepts an optional size parameter. If used, abort will only occur if both serial number and allocation size match the request.
* fixed a bug where mem_debug_total_alloced_bytes would return wrong values for thread-scope memory usage, in case memory allocated by this thread has been freed by a different thread.

v1.0.4, 20181007
----------------
* added is_global option to mem_debug_total_alloced_bytes to allow checking memory usage of the current thread.
* in mem_debug_show_leak_list, usage of FLOG with a very long line could cause a memory allocation when the mem_debug mutex is locked. Use safe_print_string instead for displaying memory leak details.

v1.0.3, 20170927
----------------
* mem_debug_total_alloced_bytes adds option to return peak amount of memory allocated.
* output errors occurring during heap operations to stderr, not stdout.

v1.0.2, 20170314
----------------
* Changed mem_debug_check_ptr to accept const pointers.

v1.0.1, 20151210
----------------
* Added mem_debug_check_ptr function.
* MEM_DEBUG_THREAD_CHECK did not behave as advertised.
* Bugfix: Possible errors if prefix or suffix size were set to zero.

v1.0.0, 20151128
----------------
* Initial release
